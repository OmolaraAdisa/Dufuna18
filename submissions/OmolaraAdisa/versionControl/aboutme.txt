My name is Adisa Omolara,a graduate of Obafemi Awolowo University. I love languages and I studied English language.
I love reading and critical analysis of texts. it interests me seeing women building eachother, its a community on its own.
I'm midway between being an introvert and an extrovert, mind you, its relative.
